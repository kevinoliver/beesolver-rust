## Requirements

* Rust 1.68 â€” though given how little language functionality is used it likely works on much earlier versions of Rust.

## Why

This was an excuse to play around with Rust. I come from a Java background and
[did this in Java first](https://github.com/kevinoliver/beesolver-java).
I'm fairly certain much of the code is not idiomatic Rust as I struggled through
a couple different parts of Rust.

## Development

Run all tests:
```
$ cargo test
```
